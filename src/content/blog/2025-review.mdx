The year of our lord 2025 has been a weird one. On one hand, personally this year has been great and I've made a lot of strides in my academic, professional, 
and personal life. On the other hand... oh boy... the US is quite chaotic, both in politics and economics and honestly there wasn't a _whole_ lot that spoke to 
me in terms of pop culture. In this post I'm mostly going to go over my personal 2025, as I could rant way too much about 2025 in the US and it would probably get 
pretty depressing.

## Progression in 2025
During New Year's, lots of people set goals to try and achieve the next year. Its become a cultural joke that these don't make it past January. So, to avoid that 
(and possibly out of laziness) I tend to look at the _past_ year and look at how I've progressed and any new things I've done. If I can't think of anything, or I feel that 
I've lost a year, I tend to be more motivated to make changes in the next year. This is the reason I feel so good about my personal 2025, since I've experience and 
accomplished a lot of new things and feel like I've progressed quite nicely throughout the year.

##### A New Blog!
The most obvious progression I've made is making this blog! This blog has really rekindled my love for writing, as well as indirectly getting me to read more. 
This has come in the form of reading other peoples' blogs, papers, and books! Before writing here, I felt that my ability to read and write critically had diminished 
and writing here has been a good exercise in both.

##### A Trip to Europe
My family and I took our first trip around Europe this year! The experience was incredible and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I got to learn so much about
history from various countries around the Mediterranean. Also ate a lot of good food!

##### A New Degree
I finished my Bachelor's degree! It was bittersweet leaving since I genuinely enjoyed getting to learn about computer science and math but man am I burnt out...

##### A New Job
While I don't start until late January, I still managed to secure a great job right out of college! This definitely took a lot of work, but its looking to be all worth 
it in th end.

## What 2026 Holds
There are a couple things that I know will inevitably happen this new year. Firstly, unless I want to drive an hour back and forth to work, I'll have to move into my 
first apartment. Luckily I have a wonderful family that's let me mooch off of them for so long, but it's time now for me to figure it all out on my own. I'm super excited 
about going out on my own, especially excited to have a whole new place to decorate how I want! Another inevitability is starting my new job! Again, incredibly excited to 
work in a role I've worked so hard for... just afraid that I'll blow something up.

Other than this, there's a lot of personal uncertainty heading into 2026. To me this is both exciting and terrifying, I've realized that I'm a person that likes to fall into 
routines but I've _also_ realized that I shouldn't keep doing the same thing for too long. Whenever I look back on routines that I fall into, rarely do I feel like every moment 
was well spent. I know that I started the post talking about how I don't like resolutions, but I'm making one anyways (This is **MY** blog after all).

My "resolution" is to try new things, get out of my comfort zone, and learn from these new experiences.

Happy New Year!
