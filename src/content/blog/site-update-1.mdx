It's been a while since I've posted! Just got back from vacation with my family and will be writing a monster of a post once I get my thoughts in order. But in the meantime, I just made some fixes to
the site worth mentioning. I'm going to try to make a small post like this whenever I might decide to improve the site on re-order stuff just so anyone can have a reference if the structure changes.
I do plan reordering the navigation tabs at some point to make room for a projects tab, search bar, and maybe a photo gallery, but that's going to be a massive pain so that won't be for a while. Anyways, here's those
changes I made:

## Mobile Nav Bugfix
- Had an issue where the date for a blog post would overlap with the mobile dropdown menu, just fiddled with the z-index until it behaved.

## Contact Form Clean-Up
- Forgot to make it so the content from the contact form cleared after submission, fixed now!

Obviously this wasn't anything exciting and probably not even worth noting, this initial website update is more of trying to get myself back in the habit of writing and a small victory to get back into the habit of coding
something meaningful everyday again. Reach out if any of you see any other bugs browsing around the site, I'll even shout you out if you want the credit!
