Just to get it out of the way first, this is in no way my favorite albums of all time. That will probably come eventually, but will require
a lot more soul-searching as to not add too many albums to the list. This is just about the artwork on the album itself, but I will
provide one or two songs from the albums that I like. But without further adew, here they are:

#### 1. Oddments - King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard

If you know me, you know that King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard(KGLW) is my all-time favorite band. I discovered them during the Covid lockdown
and they introduced me to plenty of new types of music. The artwork for Oddments has _so_ much going on and so much detail and I'm here for it.
between the level of detail packed into evey corner of the cover and the stunning colors, it's my all-time favorite. 

I love KGLW's more recent artwork as well, but theres something about the old-school, psychadelic, and cartoon-y style of this artwork.
I'm not a guy with tattoo's and probably won't ever get any, but this album cover has had me thinking about getting some ink of the candles in the
top left.

As for the music on this album, its pretty good! KGLW's most popular song _Work This Time_ is on this record and definately a crowd favorite.

Now this song is obviously insanely good. Great vibes and an introspective piece, but my favorite on the album is _It's Got Old_. I'm a sucker
for some good harmonica.

#### 2. Wlfgrl - Machine Girl
![Wlfgrl Album Cover - Machine Girl](/wlfgrl-cover.jpg)

What a visceral album cover. Like other Machine Girl album covers, this perfectly encapsulates the aesthetic every 2010's gamer wanted to attain.
What I think is funny too is that the wolf is literally just a prop from the movie [_An American Werewolf in London_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_London)
(which is a great movie!) that's been heavily microwaved and edited over. 

Again, the main reason I like this album cover is the colors. This has the added appeal of a textured appearence because of the microwaving
and honestly I can feel the artwork every time I look at it. 

Be warned, Machine Girls' music is _very_ chaotic and definately not for everybody. Think a rave but scary. But even if you don't like the
music, their concerts are insane and worth going to if only for the experience. I was lucky enough to see them in Cleveland a few years ago
and it was such a fun experience. My girlfriend and I got seats on the balcony of [The House of Blues](https://www.houseofblues.com/cleveland) in Cleveland
and the vocalist Matt Stephenson literally scaled the wall and started singing from where we were sitting on the balcony. It was so sick!

Anyways, my favorite song on this album is _Ghost_. It's a little more laid back than most of their discography (as is most of Wlfgrl) and 
is just one of those songs you can't help but bob your head to.

#### 3. Famous Monsters - The Misfits

I'm not afraid to admit it... Famous Monsters is my favorite Misfits album. There I said it SUE ME. Also are you noticing a theme in the art I like?
More bold color choices, another illustration? Even though I was merely born in 2003, this gives me nostalgia for old-school creature features
and comic books. this album art is just purely high school Halloween vibes. A bunch of buff dudes standing in a graveyard wearing 
corpse paint and a weird reverse rat tail under a full moon is just such a vibe. For me, The Misfits will always be associated directly with Halloween
in my mind, and I hope to one day be rocking out to them
handing out Halloween candy. I love this band so much and I think this is them at their peak (yes even without Glenn Danzig!)

My favorite song on this album is tied between two (boring, I know) but I genuinely cannot pick between them. The first one is _Saturday Night_:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3jXptpf8Z3aU9O1Bj6YCl0?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

This is probably the least Misfits song ever, but its just a good song and you can't deny it. Incredible vocals and a wonderful vibe.

My second song in the tie is _Dust to Dust_:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/51wFNWeRcxWoFqVFsNCg93?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

This is a much more Misfits song, and (maybe?) my favorite in their discography. The hard-hitting drums in the pocket and **chunky** 
guitar riff is such a great intro into what the Misfits are all about.

So yeah! There they are, my top album covers. Honestly, I'm probably missing a few and I'll be banging my head against a wall over it in a few months;
but these are the first I think of. Let me know any of your favorite album covers, or any of your favorite music in general! I'm always looking
for new stuff to listen to.
