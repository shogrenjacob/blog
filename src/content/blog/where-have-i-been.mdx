So its been... about three months since I last posted here. I know my devoted readers are just _chomping_ at the bit for my next blog post, so here it is! I
didn't want to just act like nothing happened before I start posting more, so here's a bit about why I've been gone.

## School
The most significant reason for my absence has been just how insane this past semester was. This was my last semester of undergrad and thus my turn to face
data structures and algorithms. For someone who isn't incredibly math-inclined this class was, as described by Dr. Kramer, hell. But, the class was _way_ more 
interesting than I could've expected. Although it took a lot to understand some of the concepts (especially [NP-Completeness!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)),
my interest in DSA pushed me through the class.

Other than DSA, I took a Machine Learning class, Video Game Development, Software Engineering, and did my Senior Project. None of these were as difficult as DSA,
but some were pretty time-consuming. Machine Learning was another extremely interesting class and I would say it was my second hardest class. Video Game development
was fun and easy and Software Engineering was essentially just a semester long group project. 

Other than DSA, the thing that took the majority of my time was my senior project, the Guin-16. The Guin-16 is a 16-bit CPU that I designed myself. It includes 
a custom instruction set and plenty of addressing modes to write programs from. I plan on writing a whole post just about this project so I'll save the details for that!

## Work
When I wasn't at school or doing homework, I was working at my internship. Between school and work I hardly had time to do my hobbies, including this blog. I don't 
have much to say about this job, as I've since quit in favor of starting my career as a software developer at another company near Cleveland! As you can imagine 
in the current state of the job market in tech it took lots of applications and time to get this new job, but I'm super excited to see what it holds for me!

## I'll Be Posting More (I Promise!)
With all this out of the way, and the fact I don't start my new job until late January, I have a lot of free time on my hands. I can finally catch up on some movies 
and shows I've been meaning to watch as well as some hobbies. I already have a couple ideas for blog posts, so I'll give a little sneak peak here:

##### Website Update 2
If you haven't noticed, I've made a couple changes to how to navigate through this site. I've also re-tuned a few things and added a new [photo gallery](https://jacobshogren.blog/photos/)!
More details and why I made these changes will be in this post.

##### The Various Takes On Geese
A band I've really liked had a popular album this year! I'll give my reaction to the album as well as some commentary on how others have been reacting to their rise.

##### A 2025 Retrospective
Some new stuff I did in 2025 and my perspective on the past year. Should have this posted by new year's!

##### Guin-16
A more detailed explanation on the CPU I created. I'm working on creating an assembler and emulator for this as we speak, so this one won't be posted for awhile.

That's it for now, you'll hear more from me soon!
